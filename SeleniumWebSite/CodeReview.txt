Page objects should be created to make code independent and more readable
Better to set dates in datepicker using JS executor since findbyelement always doesnt succeed
better to have extension wait method through out or a common wait method rather than explicit waits wherever needed in code
Autocomplete boxes doesnt always succeed using list of webelements, since we are giving the destination and from location as text its better to tab out and get the default selected
